        <h1>Jingliu</h1>
        <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;font-size: 20px;">Once the sword master of the Xianzhou Luofu, as well as 
            Jing Yuan's mentor. After succumbing<br> to mara and going insane, she managed to escape Starskiff Haven in the Year 7380 of the Star Calendar,<br> 
            and easily froze all the Cloud Knights sent after her before Jing Yuan finally confronted and defeated her<br> in battle. 
            However, she managed to survive the encounter and traveled the galaxies outside the Luofu for<br> centuries. At some unknown point, 
            Jingliu "made a deal" to regain her sanity, which Luocha has proposed<br> to be the solution to mara.</p>
