        <p style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size: 20px;">The current Supreme Guardian of Belobog, she is the young and capable commander of the Silvermane Guards. 
            Bronya received rigorous education from an early age, and possesses the grace and affinity as expected of an heir.
            Originally from Belobog's Underworld and the same orphanage as Seele, she was picked from a handful of children 
            to become the next Supreme Guardian and adopted by Cocolia.
